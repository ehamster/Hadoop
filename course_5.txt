    different between hadoop1 and 2
    
hadoop 1 has task tracker no node manager. job tracker run on master manager all program
jobtracker figure out how much resource  app need



hadoop 2 has node manager,every application manager by application master in different nodes.
only application master maintain global info in h2
when one app appear the resource manager ask node manager to create app manager instance   //communcate with tcpip
1 node manager only have 1 app manager

1 app master manage 1 app

benefit form h1 to h2
1. job tracker do almost everything, h1 can do just mapreducer,h2 is flexible,support more engine
2. each app manager by different app master.
